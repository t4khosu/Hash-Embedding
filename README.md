# Hash Embedding / Bloom Embedding

This algorithm is based on [Svenstrup et al.](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/f0f6ba4b5e0000340312d33c212c3ae8-Paper.pdf)

The notebook is inspired by a greate blog entry from [Matthew Honnibal](https://support.prodi.gy/t/can-you-explain-how-exactly-hashembed-works/564).
If you are interested in NLP, you should check out his and his teams work!

There are also keras implementations for this algorithms. If you want to learn more,
check out [dsv77's repo](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/t4khosu/Hash-Embedding/blob/main/embedding.ipynb).
